The language has grammatical case, but only for special categories of nouns and pronouns.

The following cases are present:
- Nominative: Used as the subject of a verb
- Accusative: Used as the object of a verb and for the object of prepositions
- Disjunctive: Used when not attached to a verb or phrase

Each case and gender / number combination has an associated morpheme which gets added to the parts of speech that exhibit case.  Those are in a table below.

| Case            | Animate | Inanimate | Plural |
| --------------- | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| **Nominative**  | -r      | -s        | -e     |
| **Accusative**  | -m      | -s        | -e     |
| **Disjunctive** | -y      | -s        | -e     |
